# Deep-Learning-Hyperparameter-Analysis

With the rapid rise in urbanization, garbage generation has increased exceedingly. This study aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images of trash into biodegradable and non-biodegradable wastes. Transfer Learning methods based on CNN have shown promising outcomes on diverse image classification problems. This paper reviews and compares the performance of twenty transfer learning models in the Keras library. The results show that the model based on NASNetMobile had the highest accuracy of 96%, while models based on Residual Networks had the least accuracy of 63%. Further, the model's learning rate, batch size, activation function, and optimizer were tuned. The two-factor ANOVA shows that the main effects of learning rate are significant. In contrast, the main effects of batch size and their interaction effect are not significant in a model's accuracy.
